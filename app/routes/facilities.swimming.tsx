                        Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to
                        move through water. The sport takes place in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake).
                        Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports, with varied distance events
                        in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley. In addition to these
                        individual events, four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay. A medley
                        relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke,
                        breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle.<br/><br/>

                        Swimming each stroke requires a set of specific techniques; in competition, there are distinct
                        regulations concerning the acceptable form for each individual stroke. There are also
                        regulations on what types of swimsuits, caps, jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at
                        competitions. Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from
                        the sport, such as tendinitis in the shoulders or knees, there are also multiple health benefits
                        associated with the sport.<br/><br/>

                    <h1><b className={'text-2xl'}>*Rules:</b></h1>
                    <p>
                        <b>Freestyle</b><br/><br/>
                        Freestyle, often called the “crawl,” is the most flexible in its rules, and it is typically the
                        fastest stroke. The only rules are that the swimmer may not push off the bottom of the pool or
                        pull on the lane line, and must touch the far wall with some part of their body. Otherwise,
                        swimmers may use any type of stroke. Freestyle is swum face-down with alternating arm strokes;
                        side-breathing; and rapid, alternating up-and-down kicks. Freestyle races begin with swimmers
                        doing forward-facing dives from either a starting block or the side of the pool. In multi-lap
                        races, swimmers can do either an open turn or a flip turn. When doing a flip turn, the swimmer
                        does not touch the wall with his/her hand. Instead, the swimmer’s feet touch the wall. At the
                        finish, freestyle swimmers touch with one hand.<br/><br/>

                        <b>Backstroke</b><br/><br/>
                        Backstroke is often thought of as “upside-down freestyle.” As in freestyle, backstroke is swum
                        with alternating arm strokes and rapid, alternating, up-and-down kicks. Unlike freestyle, the
                        swimmer must be on his/her back, facing the sky. When swimmers turn their shoulders more than 90
                        degrees, they are disqualified from the race for not remaining on their backs. The only
                        exception to this rule applies to the flip turn in multi-lap backstroke races: Swimmers may turn
                        onto their stomachs for one arm pull, provided their arm movement is continuous. When their feet
                        leave the wall, swimmers must be on their backs. Backstroke races start with swimmers already in
                        the water. Swimmers place their feet against the wall, and hold onto either the gutter or the
                        grip built into the starting block. At the finish of the race, backstroke swimmers must stay on
                        their backs until they touch the wall, ideally with one hand.<br/><br/>

                        <b>Breastroke</b><br/><br/>
                        Breastroke is often thought of as the “frog stroke,” as the kick is reminiscent of a frog’s
                        kick. A breaststroke swimmers arms and legs must move simultaneously, on the same horizontal
                        plane, and identically to each other. The arms and legs stay mostly underwater, but a swimmer’s
                        head must break the surface every stroke. So-called scissor kicks are not allowed. The arm
                        stroke begins and ends in streamline position. The hands scoop water out to the sides, before
                        sweeping in toward the middle of the body and then shooting forward. Swimmers are not allowed to
                        pull their hands down past their hips, and must keep their elbows in the water when their hands
                        are shooting forward. On the breastroke kick, swimmers must point their toes out to the side as
                        the feet sweep out, around, and back together. For every arm stroke there must be one, and only
                        one, kick.<br/><br/>

                        Breaststroke races begin with a forward-facing dive from either the edge of the pool or the
                        starting block. At the beginning of each lap, swimmers may do one pull-down: one huge pull, in
                        which the hands sweep down to the thighs, and one giant kick to the surface. On the first stroke
                        after the pull-down, a swimmer’s head must break the surface of the water. Today’s swimmers are
                        also allowed to do one dolphin/butterfly kick in the first part of the pull-down, before the
                        first breastroke kick. At the end of each lap of a breaststroke race, swimmers must touch with
                        two hands, simultaneously and on the same horizontal plane. In multi-lap races, swimmers will
                        use open turns, not flip turns.<br/><br/>

                        <b>Butterfly</b><br/><br/>
                        Butterfly emerged as a new stroke in the 1950s, as swimmers were trying to find ways to swim
                        breastroke faster. The two primary innovations were the double over-the-water arm recovery, and
                        the dolphin kick. Butterfly is swum with an undulating, dolphin-like movement at the surface of
                        the water. The arms pull underwater simultaneously, and recover over the water, also
                        simultaneously. Both hands must come out of the water at the same time on every stroke. During
                        each arm pull, swimmers do two dolphin kicks, one when the hands enter the water, and one when
                        the hands exit the water. A swimmer’s feet must kick up and down together, ideally with the feet
                        kept close together. While the vast majority of swimmers lift the head and shoulders to breathe,
                        some swimmers breathe to the side, as in freestyle.<br/><br/>

                        Butterfly races begin with a forward-facing dive, and swimmers must finish each lap by touching
                        the wall with two hands simultaneously, on the same horizontal plane. At the beginning of each
                        lap, swimmers will do underwater dolphin kicks, but must break the surface of the water with
                        their head at or before 15 meters. In multi-lap races, swimmers will do open turns, as opposed
                        to flip turns.<br/><br/>

                        <b>Individual Medley Events</b><br/><br/>
                        The individual medley, or IM (pronounced “eye-em”), is a race in which the swimmers swim each
                        stroke for one-fourth the total distance of the race. During each portion of the event, swimmers
                        must swim the strokes legally. For example, swimmers must finish the butterfly and breaststroke
                        laps with two-hand-touches and finish the backstroke lap on their backs. They must also swim the
                        strokes in this order: butterfly, backstroke, breastroke, freestyle. IM events begin with a
                        forward-facing dive.<br/><br/>

                        <b>Relays</b><br/><br/>
                        In a relay, four swimmers compete as a team. A swimmer may swim only once in a relay, and must
                        swim one-fourth the total distance of the race. In a freestyle relay, all swimmers swim
                        freestyle. In a medley relay, each swimmer swims a different stroke. In a medley relay the
                        strokes must be swum in this order: backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, freestyle.<br/><br/>

                        Freestyle relays begin with a forward-facing dive, while medley relays begin with a backstroke
                        start. All the other swimmers in a relay can begin with a “rolling” start, provided they do not
                        leave the blocks before their teammate touches the wall. (In a rolling start, swimmers stand at
                        the back of the starting block, and generate momentum by swinging their arms, and taking a step
                        to the front of the block.)<br/><br/>
