                        Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although
                        it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one
                        player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a
                        casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor
                        court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the
                        other team's half of the court.<br/><br/>

                        Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the
                        shuttlecock has struck the floor or ground, or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service
                        judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.<br/><br/>

                        The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile that flies
                        differently from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much
                        higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high
                        top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the
                        sport its distinctive nature, and in certain languages, e.g. German, the sport is named by
                        reference to this feature i.e. Federball, literally feather-ball.<br/><br/>

                        The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock.
                        European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with
                        recent competitions dominated by China. In 1992, badminton debuted as a Summer Olympic sport
                        with four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles; mixed
                        doubles was added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness:
                        players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical
                        sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements
                        involving much greater flexibility in the wrist than some other racquet sports.<br/><br/>

                    <h1><b className={'text-2xl'}>*Rules:</b></h1>
                    <p>
                        <b>Court</b><br/><br/>
                        The court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Courts are usually marked for both
                        singles and doubles play, although badminton rules permit a court to be marked for singles
                        only.[14] The doubles court is wider than the singles court, but both are of the same length.
                        The exception, which often causes confusion to newer players, is that the doubles court has a
                        shorter serve-length dimension.<br/><br/>

                        The full width of the court is 6.1 metres (20 feet), and in singles this width is reduced to
                        5.18 metres (17.0 feet). The full length of the court is 13.4 metres (44 feet). The service
                        courts are marked by a centre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service line at a
                        distance of 1.98 metres (6 feet 6 inches) from the net, and by the outer side and back
                        boundaries. In doubles, the service court is also marked by a long service line, which is 0.76
                        metres (2 feet 6 inches) from the back boundary.<br/><br/>

                        The net is 1.55 metres (5 feet 1 inch) high at the edges and 1.524 metres (5.00 feet) high in
                        the centre. The net posts are placed over the doubles sidelines, even when singles is
                        played.<br/><br/>

                        The minimum height for the ceiling above the court is not mentioned in the Laws of Badminton.
                        Nonetheless, a badminton court will not be suitable if the ceiling is likely to be hit on a high
                        serve.<br/><br/>

                        <b>Serving</b><br/><br/>
                        When the server serves, the shuttlecock must pass over the short service line on the opponents'
                        court or it will count as a fault. The server and receiver must remain within their service
                        courts, without touching the boundary lines, until the server strikes the shuttlecock. The other
                        two players may stand wherever they wish, so long as they do not block the vision of the server
                        or receiver.<br/><br/>

                        At the start of the rally, the server and receiver stand in diagonally opposite service courts
                        (see court dimensions). The server hits the shuttlecock so that it would land in the receiver's
                        service court. This is similar to tennis, except that in a badminton serve the whole shuttle
                        must be below 1.15 metres from the surface of the court at the instant of being hit by the
                        server's racket, the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce and in badminton, the players stand
                        inside their service courts, unlike tennis.<br/><br/>

                        When the serving side loses a rally, the server immediately passes to their opponent(s) (this
                        differs from the old system where sometimes the serve passes to the doubles partner for what is
                        known as a "second serve").<br/><br/>

                        In singles, the server stands in their right service court when their score is even, and in
                        their left service court when their score is odd.<br/><br/>

                        In doubles, if the serving side wins a rally, the same player continues to serve, but he/she
                        changes service courts so that she/he serves to a different opponent each time. If the opponents
                        win the rally and their new score is even, the player in the right service court serves; if odd,
                        the player in the left service court serves. The players' service courts are determined by their
                        positions at the start of the previous rally, not by where they were standing at the end of the
                        rally. A consequence of this system is that each time a side regains the service, the server
                        will be the player who did not serve last time.<br/><br/>

                        <b>Scoring</b><br/><br/>
                        Each game is played to 21 points, with players scoring a point by winning a rally.[14] This
                        differs from the old system in which players may only win a point on their serve and each game
                        is to 15 points. A match is the best of three games.<br/><br/>

                        If the score ties at 20–20, then the game continues until one side gains a two-point lead (such
                        as 24–22), except when there is a tie at 29–29, in which the game goes to a golden point of 30.
                        Whoever scores this point wins the game.<br/><br/>

                        At the start of a match, the shuttlecock is cast and the side towards which the shuttlecock is
                        pointing serves first. Alternatively, a coin may be tossed, with the winners choosing whether to
                        serve or receive first, or choosing which end of the court to occupy first, and their opponents
                        making the remaining choice.<br/><br/>

                        In subsequent games, the winners of the previous game serve first. Matches are best out of
                        three: a player or pair must win two games (of 21 points each) to win the match. For the first
                        rally of any doubles game, the serving pair may decide who serves and the receiving pair may
                        decide who receives. The players change ends at the start of the second game; if the match
                        reaches a third game, they change ends both at the start of the game and when the leading
                        player's or pair's score reaches 11 points.<br/><br/>

                        <b>Lets</b><br/><br/>
                        If a let is called, the rally is stopped and replayed with no change to the score. Lets may
                        occur because of some unexpected disturbance such as a shuttlecock landing on a court (having
                        been hit there by players playing in adjacent court) or in small halls the shuttle may touch an
                        overhead rail which can be classed as a let.<br/><br/>

                        If the receiver is not ready when the service is delivered, a let shall be called; yet, if the
                        receiver attempts to return the shuttlecock, the receiver shall be judged to have been
                        ready.<br/><br/>
