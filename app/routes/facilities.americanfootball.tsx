                        American football, also known as gridiron football, is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a
                        rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with possession of the
                        oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or throwing
                        it, while the defense, the team without possession of the ball, aims to stop the offense's
                        advance and to take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten
                        yards in four downs or plays; if they fail, they turn over the football to the defense, but if
                        they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive. A game is won by the
                        team with the higher number of points, which are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the
                        opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts
                        for a field goal.<br/><br/>

                        American football evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of soccer and
                        rugby. The first American football match was played on November 6, 1869, between two college
                        teams, Rutgers and Princeton, using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time. A set of
                        rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp, the "Father of American Football",
                        established the snap, the line of scrimmage, eleven-player teams, and the concept of downs.
                        Later rule changes legalized the forward pass, created the neutral zone, and specified the size
                        and shape of the football. The sport is closely related to Canadian football, which evolved in
                        parallel with and at the same time as the American game, although its rules were developed
                        independently from those of Camp. Most of the features that distinguish American football from
                        rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football. The two sports are considered the
                        primary variants of gridiron football.<br/><br/>

                        American football is the most popular sport in the United States in terms of broadcast
                        viewership audience. The most popular forms of the game are professional and college football,
                        with the other major levels being high-school and youth football. As of 2022, nearly 1.04
                        million high-school athletes play the sport in the U.S., with another 81,000 college athletes in
                        the NCAA and the NAIA. The National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance
                        of any professional sports league in the world. Its championship game, the Super Bowl, ranks
                        among the most-watched club sporting events globally. In 2022, the league had an annual revenue
                        of around $18.6 billion, making it the most valuable sports league in the world. Other
                        professional and amateur leagues exist worldwide, but the sport does not have the international
                        popularity of other American sports like baseball or basketball; the sport maintains a growing
                        following in the rest of North America, Europe, Brazil, and Japan.<br/><br/>

                        <b>Scoring</b><br/><br/>
                        In football, the winner is the team that has scored more points at the end of the game. There
                        are multiple ways to score in a football game. The touchdown (TD), worth six points, is the most
                        valuable scoring play in American football. A touchdown is scored when a live ball is advanced
                        into, caught, or recovered in the opposing team's end zone. The scoring team then attempts a
                        try, more commonly known as the point(s)-after-touchdown (PAT) or conversion, which is a single
                        scoring opportunity. This is generally attempted from the two- or three-yard line, depending on
                        the level of play. If the PAT is scored by a place kick or drop kick through the goal posts, it
                        is worth one point, typically called the extra point. If the PAT is scored by what would
                        normally be a touchdown, it is worth two points; this is known as a two-point conversion. In
                        general, the extra point is almost always successful, while the two-point conversion is a much
                        riskier play with a higher probability of failure; accordingly, extra point attempts are far
                        more common than two-point conversion attempts.<br/><br/>

                        A field goal (FG), worth three points, is scored when the ball is place kicked or drop kicked
                        through the uprights and over the crossbars of the defense's goalposts. In practice,
                        almost all field goal attempts are done via place kick. While drop kicks were common in the
                        early days of the sport, the shape of modern footballs makes it difficult to reliably drop kick
                        the ball. The last successful scoring play by drop kick in the NFL was accomplished in 2006;
                        prior to that, the last successful drop kick had been made in 1941. After a PAT attempt or
                        successful field goal, the scoring team must kick the ball off to the other team.<br/><br/>

                        A safety is scored when the ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone. Safeties are worth two
                        points, which are awarded to the defense. In addition, the team that conceded the safety
                        must kick the ball to the scoring team via a free kick.<br/><br/>

                        <b>Field & Equipment</b><br/><br/>
                        A football field as seen from behind one end zone. The tall, yellow goal posts mark where the
                        ball must pass for a successful field goal or extra point. The large, rectangular area marked
                        with the team name is the end zone.<br/><br/>

                        Football games are played on a rectangular field that measures 120 yards (110 m) long and 53+1⁄3
                        yards (48.8 m) wide. Lines marked along the ends and sides of the field are known as the end
                        lines and sidelines. Goal lines are marked 10 yards (9.1 m) inward from each end
                        line.<br/><br/>

                        Weighted pylons are placed the sidelines on the inside corner of the intersections with the goal
                        lines and end lines. White markings on the field identify the distance from the end zone.
                        Inbound lines, or hash marks, are short parallel lines that mark off 1-yard (0.91 m) increments.
                        Yard lines, which can run the width of the field, are marked every 5 yards (4.6 m). A
                        one-yard-wide line is placed at each end of the field; this line is marked at the center of the
                        two-yard line in professional play and at the three-yard line in college play. Numerals that
                        display the distance from the closest goal line in yards are placed on both sides of the field
                        every ten yards.<br/><br/>

                        Goalposts are located at the center of the plane of the two end lines. The crossbar of these
                        posts is 10 feet (3.0 m) above the ground, with vertical uprights at the end of the crossbar 18
                        feet 6 inches (5.64 m) apart for professional and collegiate play, and 23 feet 4 inches (7.11 m)
                        apart for high school play. The uprights extend vertically 35 feet (11 m) on
                        professional fields, a minimum of 10 yards (9.1 m) on college fields, and a minimum of 10 feet
                        (3.0 m) on high school fields. Goal posts are padded at the base, and orange ribbons are
                        normally placed at the tip of each upright as indicators of wind strength and
                        direction.<br/><br/>

                        The football itself is a prolate spheroid leather ball, similar to the balls used in rugby or
                        Australian rules football. To contain the compressed air within it, a pig's bladder was
                        commonly used before the advent of artificial rubber inside the leather outer shell to sustain
                        crushing forces. At all levels of play, the football is inflated to 12+1⁄2 to 13+1⁄2 psi
                        (86 to 93 kPa), or just under one atmosphere, and weighs 14 to 15 ounces (400 to 430
                        g); beyond that, the exact dimensions vary slightly. In professional play the ball
                        has a long axis of 11 to 11+1⁄4 inches (28 to 29 cm), a long circumference of 28 to 28+1⁄2
                        inches (71 to 72 cm), and a short circumference of 21 to 21+1⁄4 inches (53 to 54 cm). In
                        college and high school play the ball has a long axis of 10+7⁄8 to 11+7⁄16 inches (27.6 to 29.1
                        cm), a long circumference of 27+3⁄4 to 28+1⁄2 inches (70 to 72 cm), and a short circumference of
                        20+3⁄4 to 21+1⁄4 inches (53 to 54 cm).<br/><br/>

                        <b>Duration & Time Stoppages</b><br/><br/>
                        Football games last for a total of 60 minutes in professional and college play and are divided
                        into two halves of 30 minutes and four quarters of 15 minutes. High school football
                        games are 48 minutes in length with two halves of 24 minutes and four quarters of 12
                        minutes. The two halves are separated by a halftime period, and the first and third quarters
                        are followed by a short break. Before the game starts, the referee and each team's
                        captain meet at midfield for a coin toss. The visiting team can call either "heads" or "tails";
                        the winner of the toss chooses whether to receive or kick off the ball or which goal they wish
                        to defend. They can defer their choice until the second half. Unless the winning team decides to
                        defer, the losing team chooses the option the winning team did not select—to receive, kick, or
                        select a goal to defend to begin the second half. Most teams choose to receive or defer, because
                        choosing to kick the ball to start the game allows the other team to choose which goal to
                        defend. Teams switch goals following the first and third quarters. If a down is in
                        progress when a quarter ends, play continues until the down is completed. If certain
                        fouls are committed during play while time has expired, the quarter may be extended through an
                        untimed down.<br/><br/>

                        Games last longer than their defined length due to play stoppages—the average NFL game lasts
                        slightly over three hours. Time in a football game is measured by the game clock. An
                        operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on the
                        direction of the appropriate official. A separate play clock is used to show the amount
                        of time within which the offense must initiate a play. The play clock is set to 25 seconds after
                        certain administrative stoppages in play and to 40 seconds when play is proceeding without such
                        stoppages. If the offense fails to start a play before the play clock reads "00", a delay of
                        game foul is called on the offense.<br/><br/>

                        <b>Advancing The Ball & Downs</b><br/><br/>
                        There are two main ways the offense can advance the ball: running and passing. In a typical
                        play, the center passes the ball backwards and between their legs to the quarterback in a
                        process known as the snap. The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a running back,
                        throws the ball, or runs with it. The play ends when the player with the ball is tackled or goes
                        out-of-bounds or a pass hits the ground without a player having caught it. A forward pass can be
                        legally attempted only if the passer is behind the line of scrimmage; only one forward pass can
                        be attempted per down. As in rugby, players can also pass the ball backwards at any point
                        during a play. In the NFL, a down also ends immediately if the runner's helmet comes
                        off.<br/><br/>

                        The offense is given a series of four plays, known as downs. If the offense advances ten or more
                        yards in the four downs, they are awarded a new set of four downs. If they fail to advance ten
                        yards, possession of the football is turned over to the defense. In most situations, if the
                        offense reaches their fourth down they will punt the ball to the other team, which forces them
                        to begin their drive from farther down the field; if they are in field goal range, they might
                        attempt to score a field goal instead. A group of officials, the chain crew, keeps track of
                        both the downs and the distance measurements. On television, a yellow line is
                        electronically superimposed on the field to show the first down line to the viewing
                        audience.<br/><br/>

                        <b>Kicking</b><br/><br/>
                        A placekicker attempts a field goal by kicking the ball from the hands of a holder.
                        Tampa Bay Buccaneers placekicker Connor Barth attempts a field goal by kicking the ball from the
                        hands of a holder. This is the standard method to score field goals or extra points.<br/><br/>

                        There are two categories of kicks in football: scrimmage kicks, which can be executed by the
                        offensive team on any down from behind or on the line of scrimmage, and free
                        kicks. The free kicks are the kickoff, which starts the first and third quarters
                        and overtime and follows a try attempt or a successful field goal; the safety kick follows a
                        safety.<br/><br/>

                        On a kickoff, the ball is placed at the 35-yard line of the kicking team in professional and
                        college play and at the 40-yard line in high school play. The ball may be drop kicked or place
                        kicked. If a place kick is chosen, the ball can be placed on the ground or a tee; a holder may
                        be used in either case. On a safety kick, the kicking team kicks the ball from their own 20-yard
                        line. They can punt, drop kick or place kick the ball, but a tee may not be used in professional
                        play. Any member of the receiving team may catch or advance the ball. The ball may be recovered
                        by the kicking team once it has gone at least ten yards and has touched the ground or has been
                        touched by any member of the receiving team.<br/><br/>

                        The three types of scrimmage kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts. Only place kicks and
                        drop kicks can score points. The place kick is the standard method used to score
                        points, because the pointy shape of the football makes it difficult to reliably drop
                        kick. Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage kick, it can be advanced by the
                        kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line of scrimmage. If it is touched or
                        recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead at the spot where it was
                        touched. The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's
                        opportunity to catch the ball. The receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch,
                        which prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver. The play ends as soon
                        as the ball is caught, and the ball may not be advanced.<br/><br/>

                        <b>Officials and fouls</b><br/><br/>
                        Officials are responsible for enforcing game rules and monitoring the clock. All officials carry
                        a whistle and wear black-and-white striped shirts and black hats except for the referee, whose
                        hat is white. Each carries a weighted yellow flag that is thrown to the ground to signal that a
                        foul has been called. An official who spots multiple fouls will throw their hat as a secondary
                        signal. Women can serve as officials; Sarah Thomas became the NFL's first female official
                        in 2015. The seven officials (of a standard seven-man crew; lower levels of play up to the
                        college level use fewer officials) on the field are each tasked with a different set of
                        responsibilities:<br/><br/>

                        *The referee is positioned behind and to the side of the offensive backs. The referee is charged
                        with oversight and control of the game and is the authority on the score, the down number, and
                        any rule interpretations in discussions among the other officials. The referee announces all
                        penalties and discusses the infraction with the offending team's captain, monitors for illegal
                        hits against the quarterback, makes requests for first-down measurements, and notifies the head
                        coach whenever a player is ejected. The referee positions themselves to the passing arm side of
                        the quarterback. In most games, the referee is responsible for spotting the football prior to a
                        play from scrimmage.<br/><br/>
                        *The umpire is positioned in the defensive backfield, except in the NFL, where the umpire is
                        positioned lateral to the referee on the opposite side of the formation. The umpire watches play
                        along the line of scrimmage to make sure that no more than 11 offensive players are on the field
                        before the snap, and that no offensive linemen are illegally downfield on pass plays. The umpire
                        monitors contact between offensive and defensive linemen and calls most of the holding
                        penalties. The umpire records the number of timeouts taken and the winner of the coin toss and
                        game score. They also assist the referee in situations involving possession of the ball close to
                        the line of scrimmage, determines whether player equipment is legal, and dries wet balls prior
                        to the snap if a game is played in rain.<br/><br/>
                        *The back judge is positioned deep in the defensive backfield, behind the umpire. The back judge
                        ensures that the defensive team has no more than 11 players on the field and determines whether
                        catches are legal, whether field goal or extra point attempts are good, and whether a pass
                        interference violation occurred. The back judge is also responsible for the play clock, the time
                        between each play, when a visible play clock is not used.<br/><br/>
                        *The head linesman/down judge is positioned on one end of the line of scrimmage. The head
                        linesman/down judge watches for any line-of-scrimmage and illegal use-of-hands violations and
                        assists the line judge with illegal shift or illegal motion calls. The head linesman/down judge
                        also rules on out-of-bounds calls that happen on their side of the field, oversees the chain
                        crew, and marks the forward progress of a runner when a play has been whistled dead.
                        *The side judge is positioned twenty yards downfield of the head linesman. The side judge mainly
                        duplicates the functions of the field judge. On field goal and extra point attempts, the side
                        judge is positioned lateral to the umpire.<br/><br/>
                        *The line judge is positioned on the end of the line of scrimmage, opposite the head linesman.
                        They supervise player substitutions, the line of scrimmage during punts, and game timing. The
                        line judge notifies the referee when time has expired at the end of a quarter and notifies the
                        head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime. In the NFL, the line judge
                        also alerts the referee when two minutes remain in the half. If the clock malfunctions or
                        becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.<br/><br/>
                        *The field judge is positioned twenty yards downfield from the line judge. The field judge
                        monitors and controls the play clock, counts the number of defensive players on the field, and
                        watches for offensive pass interference and illegal use-of-hands violations by offensive
                        players. The field judge also makes decisions regarding catches, recoveries, the ball spot when
                        a player goes out of bounds, and illegal touching of fumbled balls that have crossed the line of
                        scrimmage. On field goal and extra point attempts, the field judge is stationed under the
                        upright opposite the back judge.<br/><br/>
                        *The center judge is an eighth official used only in the top level of college football. The
                        center judge stands lateral to the referee, the same way the umpire does in the NFL. The center
                        judge is responsible for spotting the football after each play and has many of the same
                        responsibilities as the referee, except announcing penalties.<br/><br/>

                        Another set of officials, the chain crew, are responsible for moving the chains. The chains,
                        consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a
                        first down. The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the
                        officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew
                        will have at least three people—two members of the chain crew will hold either of the two
                        sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on
                        it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down and is typically moved to the
                        approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is
                        considered an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either
                        side.<br/><br/>
