            The 2024 Summer Olympics, officially the Games of the XXXIII
            Olympiad and commonly known as Paris 2024, is an upcoming
            international multi-sport event scheduled to take place from 26 July
            to 11 August 2024 in France, with Paris as the main host city and 16
            other cities spread across Metropolitan France, plus one subsite in
            Tahiti—an island within the French overseas country and overseas
            collectivity of French Polynesia.
            <br />
            <br />
            Paris was awarded the Games at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru,
            on 13 September 2017. After multiple withdrawals that left only
            Paris and Los Angeles in contention, the International Olympic
            Committee (IOC) approved a process to concurrently award the 2024
            and 2028 Summer Olympics to the two remaining candidate cities.
            Having previously hosted in 1900 and 1924, Paris will become the
            second city to host the Summer Olympics three times (after London
            which hosted the 1908, 1948 and 2012 Games). Paris 2024 will mark
            the centenary of Paris 1924 and Chamonix 1924, and these will be the
            sixth Olympic Games hosted by France (three Summer Olympics and
            three Winter Olympics) and the first French Olympics since the 1992
            Winter Games in Albertville. The Summer Games will return to the
            traditional four-year Olympiad cycle, after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics
            were postponed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
            <br />
            <br />
            Paris 2024 will feature the debut of breakdancing as an Olympic
            event, and it will be the final Olympic Games held during the IOC
            presidency of Thomas Bach. The 2024 Games are expected to cost €8.3
            billion.
            <br />
            <br />
            The six candidate cities were Paris, Hamburg, Boston, Budapest,
            Rome, and Los Angeles. The bidding process was slowed by
            withdrawals, political uncertainty and deterring costs. Boston
            surpassed Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, DC in the
            official US bid. On 27 July 2015, Boston and the USOC mutually
            agreed to terminate Boston's bid to host the Games, partly due to
            mixed feelings in the city of Boston. Hamburg withdrew its bid on 29
            November 2015 after holding a referendum. Rome withdrew on 21
            September 2016, citing fiscal difficulties. Budapest withdrew on 22
            February 2017, after a petition against the bid collected more
            signatures than necessary for a referendum.
            <br />
            <br />
            Following these withdrawals, the IOC Executive Board met on 9 June
            2017 in Lausanne, Switzerland, to discuss the 2024 and 2028 bid
            processes. The International Olympic Committee formally proposed
            electing the 2024 and 2028 Olympic host cities at the same time in
            2017, a proposal which an Extraordinary IOC Session approved on 11
            July 2017 in Lausanne. The IOC set up a process whereby the LA 2024
            and Paris 2024 bid committees met with the IOC to discuss which city
            would host the Games in 2024 and 2028, and whether it was possible
            to select the host cities for both at the same time.
            <br />
            <br />
            Following the decision to award the two games simultaneously, Paris
            was understood to be the preferred host for 2024. On 31 July 2017,
            the IOC announced Los Angeles as the sole candidate for 2028,
            enabling Paris to be confirmed as host for 2024. Both decisions were
            ratified at the 131st IOC Session on 13 September 2017.
            <br />
            <br />
            Paris was elected as the host city on 13 September 2017 at the 131st
            IOC Session in Lima, Peru. The two French IOC members, Guy Drut and
            Tony Estanguet, were ineligible to vote under the rules of the
            Olympic Charter.

            Most of the Olympic events will be held in the city of Paris and its
            metropolitan region, including the neighbouring cities of
            Saint-Denis, Le Bourget, Nanterre, Versailles, and Vaires-sur-Marne.
            <br />
            <br />
            The basketball preliminaries and handball finals will be held in
            Lille, which is 225 km (140 mi) from the host city; the sailing and
            some football games will be held in the Mediterranean city of
            Marseille, which is 777 km (483 mi) from the host city; meanwhile,
            the surfing events are expected to be held in Teahupo'o village in
            the overseas territory of French Polynesia, which is 15,716 km
            (9,765 mi) from Paris, the host city. Football will also be hosted
            in another five cities, which are Bordeaux, Décines-Charpieu (Lyon),
            Nantes, Nice and Saint-Étienne, some of which are home to Ligue 1
            clubs.

          <p>
            Paris 2024 president Tony Estanguet unveiled the Olympic and
            Paralympic medals for the Games in February 2024, which on the
            obverse featured embedded hexagon-shaped tokens of scrap iron that
            had been taken from the original construction of the Eiffel Tower,
            with the Games logo engraved into it. Approximately 5,084 medals
            would be produced by the French mint Monnaie de Paris, and were
            designed by Chaumet, a luxury jewellery firm based in Paris.
            <br />
            <br />
            The reverse of the medals features Nike, the Greek goddess of
            victory, inside the Panathenaic Stadium which hosted the first
            modern Olympics in 1896. Parthenon and the Eiffel Tower can also be
            seen in the background on both sides of the medal. Each medal weighs
            455–529 g (16–19 oz), has a diameter of 85 mm (3.3 in) and is 9.2 mm
            (0.36 in) thick. The gold medals are made with 98.8 percent silver
            and 1.13 percent gold, while the bronze medals are made up with
            copper, zinc, and tin.

          <p>
            France reached an agreement with Europol and the UK Home Office to
            help strengthen security and "facilitate operational information
            exchange" and "international law enforcement cooperation" during the
            Games. Within the agreements, it was planned to deploy more drones
            and sea barriers to prevent small boats from crossing the channel
            illegally. The British Army will also be deploying Starstreak
            surface-to-air missile units for air security. Police in Paris held
            inspections and rehearsals within their bomb disposal unit before
            the Games, similar to their preparations for the 2023 Rugby World
            Cup at the Stade de France.

            <br />
            As a part of Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani visit to
            France, several agreements were signed between two nations to
            enhance security for the Olympics. In preparation for the
            significant security demands and counterterrorist measures, Poland
            has pledged to contribute security troops, including sniffer dog
            handlers, to support international efforts aimed at ensuring the
            safety of the Games. The Qatari Minister of Interior and Commander
            of Lekhwiya convened a meeting on 3 April 2024 ahead of the
            Olympics, with officials and security leaders, including Nasser
            Al-Khelaifi and Sheikh Jassim bin Mansour Al Thani to discuss
            security operations, while US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel to
            modernize the command structure of the security alliance with Japan.

            Security concerns impacted the announced plans for the opening
            ceremony to take place as a public event along the Seine; the
            expected attendance was reduced by half from an estimated 600,000 to
            300,000, with plans for free viewing locations now being by
            invitation only. In April 2024, after Islamic State claimed
            responsibility for the Crocus City Hall attack in March, and made
            several threats against the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals,
            French president Emmanuel Macron indicated that the opening ceremony
            could be scaled back or re-located if necessary.

            <b>Opening Ceremony</b>
          </h1>
          <p>
            The opening ceremony is scheduled to begin at 19:30 (CEST, GMT+2) on
            26 July 2024. The ceremony is tentatively scheduled to take place
            outside a traditional stadium setting for the first time, with plans
            for the parade of nations to be conducted as a boat parade along the
            Seine from Pont d'Austerlitz to Pont d'Iéna, and the official
            protocol to take place at Place du Trocadéro in a temporary
            "mini-stadium". The 6-kilometre (3.7-mile) parade route would
            feature cultural presentations and views of Paris landmarks. The
            ceremonies of the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympics will be
            directed by Thomas Jolly.
            <br />
            <br />
            Organisers have promoted the ceremony as "the most spectacular and
            accessible opening ceremony in Olympic history", with COJOP2024
            president Tony Estanguet stating that it would be free to attend,
            estimating that it could attract as many as 600,000
            spectators—exemplifying an overall goal for Paris 2024 to be a
            "people's Olympics". There will be 100,000 ticketed spectators at
            viewing spots on the lower banks of the Seine, and approximately
            200,000 spectators at free viewing spots on the upper banks (in
            addition to being visible from other public locations and
            buildings). In March 2024, due to security concerns, the French
            government ordered that access to the upper bank locations be by
            invitation only, and in April 2024, President Macron stated that the
            ceremony could be scaled back or held in a conventional manner at
            Stade de France, if necessary.

            The programme of the 2024 Summer Olympics will feature 329 events in
            32 sports, including the 28 "core" Olympic sports contested in 2016
            and 2020, and four optional sports that were proposed by the Paris
            Organising Committee: breaking will make its Olympic debut as an
            optional sport, while skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing
            will return from 2020. Four events have been dropped from
            weightlifting. In canoeing, two sprint events have been replaced
            with two slalom events, keeping the overall total at 16. In sport
            climbing, the previous "combined" event has been divided into
            separate speed climbing and boulder & lead disciplines for each
            gender.

            Association) where Russian and Belarusian athletes would compete
            with no restrictions, also accusing the IBA of attempting to
            sabotage the IOC-approved qualification pathway for the 2024 Summer
            Olympics. Poland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Great Britain,
            Ireland, the Czech Republic, Sweden and Canada later joined the U.S.
