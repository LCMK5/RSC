            The Boston Celtics are one win away from a record 18th NBA Finals
            title. They will aim to sweep the Dallas Mavericks when they meet
            again for Game 4 in their best-of-seven series on Friday at 8:30
            p.m. ET. If the Celtics win again, they will add to their
            franchise's storied history by securing their first title since
            2008.
            <br />
            <br />
            On Wednesday, Boston held off a furious Dallas fourth-quarter
            comeback in Game 3 and won 106-99. The Celtics got 61 combined
            points from Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown as Boston improved to 7-0
            on the road in the 2024 playoffs.
            <br />
            <br />
            Dallas fell down by 21 points but went on a 22-2 run to cut the lead
            to one point. Luka Doncic, however, fouled out for the first time in
            his playoff career and the Mavericks couldn't get over the hump with
            their superstar on the bench. Doncic finished with 27 points while
            Kyrie Irving scored a game-high 35.
            <br />
            <br />
            Boston also improved to 10-1 in these playoffs without Kristaps
            Porzingis after the 7-foot-2 Latvian was ruled out before the game
            because of a rare tendon injury in his lower left leg sustained in
            Game 2. On Thursday, coach Joe Mazzulla said the Celtics center is
            'fighting like hell to play' in Game 4, but his status for the rest
            of the series is still up in the air.
            <br />
            <br />
            No team has ever come back from a 0-3 deficit in the NBA Finals.
            Boston can become the 10th team to ever sweep its opponent in the
            NBA Finals if they win Friday's Game 4. Regardless of which of these
            remaining teams win the 2024 title, the NBA will have its sixth
            different champion in six years -- something that has not happened
            since 1975-1980.
            <br />
            <br />
            The postseason field started with 20 teams, and now we're down to
            two. The Warriors, Kings, Hawks and Bulls were ousted in the Play-In
            Tournament before the Pelicans, Suns, Clippers, Lakers, Heat, 76ers,
            Bucks and Magic were eliminated in the first round. The Cavaliers,
            Thunder, Knicks and Nuggets were sent home in the second round with
            the Pacers and Timberwolves bowing out in the conference finals.
